## Time Series Models in R
- This repository contains the stock price prediction using ARIMA models, where I analysed a single time series variable - daily tesla stock closing price based on historical data
and applied statistical concepts, including stationarity, hypothesis test, model specification and diagnostic checking,etc, to predict the short-term and long-term 
price trend in the future. 
- keep learning and updating projects related to multivariable time series and more complex concepts.
